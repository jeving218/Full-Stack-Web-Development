Hi ,
I am writing to express my interest in the software developer role at  Wipro in India. I recently came across the job listing on Company Website and was immediately drawn to the company's mission and values.
With 2 years of experience in development , I have developed skills in python. I believe my experience and skills align well with the requirements of the position.
I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work at Wipro in India.
I have attached my resume for your review. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing back from you.
Sincerely.
